# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a React Native mobile application for the Chit Fund Management System. The app will provide a comprehensive interface for managing chit funds, loans, user accounts, and analytics. The application will consume the existing backend API endpoints to deliver a seamless mobile experience for chit fund administrators and users.

5. WHEN I submit a valid loan payment THEN the system SHALL update the loan balance and transaction history
6. WHEN I need to deactivate a loan THEN the system SHALL provide an option to force close the loan with an optional reason
7. WHEN viewing loan details THEN the system SHALL display borrowed amount, balance, amount paid, and payment history

### Requirement 4: Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a chit fund administrator, I want to view comprehensive analytics so that I can monitor the overall performance of the chit fund system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the analytics section THEN the system SHALL display key performance indicators including total users, active chits, and pending loans
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show total amounts in chits, pending chit payments, and loan amounts

### Requirement 5: Navigation and User Interface

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want an intuitive navigation system so that I can easily access different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the app THEN the system SHALL display a main dashboard with quick access to all major sections
2. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of the current section
3. WHEN I use the app THEN the system SHALL follow React Native design patterns and provide responsive layouts
4. WHEN I interact with forms THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
5. WHEN I view lists THEN the system SHALL implement proper scrolling and loading states
6. WHEN network requests are in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators

### Requirement 6: API Integration and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API integration so that the mobile app can communicate effectively with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load API configuration from a centralized config file

4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages based on status codes (400, 404, 409, 500)
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms
6. WHEN API responses include transaction history THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order

### Requirement 7: Data Validation and Error Handling
